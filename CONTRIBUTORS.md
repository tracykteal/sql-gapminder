Materials have been developed and adapted by many contributors and were originally adapted for an ecology audience in 2012 by Ethan White based on Greg Wilson's Software Carpentry lectures.

The first Data Carpentry workshop was run at NESCent on May 8-9, 2014 with the
development and instruction of lessons by Karen Cranston, Hilmar Lapp, Tracy
Teal and Ethan White and contributions from Deb Paul and Mike Smorul.
